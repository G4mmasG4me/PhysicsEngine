Dynamic Mesh Generator
- Calculate and Store mesh whenver object is rotated


Static Mesh with Transform Data 
- Only calculates mesh data, then applies transform data such as position and rotation whenver simulating ray tracing



Have to decide angle axis and layout

Camera Faces Negative Z
Right Hand Rule
+X is Right
+Y is Up
-Z is Forward

Need to implement a clip matrix

Need to implement a projection matrix



Ray tracing
create line
loop through all objects
find closest intersection
then calculate 


create primary ray
find closest intersection
draw secondary light ray to light sources
draw reflection rays





---- all intersection equations are done using zerod object









----- Current Errors -----
Current method for refraction
-if the previous intersection is a  with the same object, refraction then the next refraction must be refraction with air
- if the previous intersection is with a different objec, then the refraction is with an object
- doesn't handle cases where shapes may be inside of each other, or cases where it refracts from one object to another
