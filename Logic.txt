Ray Tracing Method

get focus position
get pixel position
shoot ray from focus to pixel 
loop through objects
  calculate intersection point 

get closest inersection point

loop through light sources
  create segment between closest intersection point and light point
  loop through objects
    calculate intersection point
    
-----5 Different Uses of The Engine----- 
---Scene Creator---
Renders in wireframes or rasterization
Allows you to create and edit scenes

---Scene Renderer---
Renders in ray tracing or ray pathing
Renders a static scene

---Game Runner---
Renders in rasterization or optimized ray tracing / ray pathing
Allows you to run a scene in real time
Need to be able to apply code to an object

---Physics Simulator---
Simulates physics using models
Saves each step, which can then be animated

---Ray Follower---
Renders in rasterization
Allows you to select a scene, and then show and follow the ray for each pixel in the canvas

---Main Logic---
I need to main things, a scene creator, a scene renderer
